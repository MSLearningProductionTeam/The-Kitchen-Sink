Next Steps:
  1. A way to add additional content to the same list item:
    -User clicks add more content, new and blank input fields replace the old ones and the user fills out more information
    -This additional information would be submitted to the same list item as the original information, it would just be separated in the sharepoint list by a comma or something like that
  2. A way to add larger file attachments to sharepoint faster
    -Large files take too long to send to sharepoint, find another way or make the current http request faster
  3. Spice up the Css
    -Add cool effects/ secondary animation to make the form feel more alive
  4. Mobile responsive design
