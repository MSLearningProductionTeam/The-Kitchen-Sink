list list poc:

create an admin view


form poc:

need onboarding for attaching multiple files at once as this is not obvious how to do

fix attaching video files so that attaching and sending a video does not crash the browser

allow large file attachments to be sent to sharepoint, files will need to be broken up and sent in smaller parts


Next Steps:
  A way to add additional content to the same list item:
    -User clicks add more content, new and blank input fields replace the old ones and the user fills out more information
    -This additional information would be submitted to the same list item as the original information, it would just be separated in the sharepoint list by a comma or something like that
  A way to add larger file attachments to sharepoint faster
    -Large files take too long to send to sharepoint, find another way or make the current http request faster
  Spice up the Css
    -Add cool effects/ secondary animation to make the form feel more alive
  Mobile responsive design
