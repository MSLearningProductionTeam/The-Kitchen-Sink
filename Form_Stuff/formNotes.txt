fix attaching video files so that attaching and sending a video does not crash the browser

allow large file attachments to be sent to sharepoint, files will need to be broken up and sent in smaller parts


Next Steps:
  1. A way to add additional content to the same list item:
    -User clicks add more content, new and blank input fields replace the old ones and the user fills out more information
    -This additional information would be submitted to the same list item as the original information, it would just be separated in the sharepoint list by a comma or something like that
  2. A way to add larger file attachments to sharepoint faster
    -Large files take too long to send to sharepoint, find another way or make the current http request faster
  3. Spice up the Css
    -Add cool effects/ secondary animation to make the form feel more alive
  4. Mobile responsive design
  5. Refactor the project file structure
    -Common css and scripts should be placed in a common css/script directory for all pages to use
      - This will require the js to be refactored, removing common/generic functionality from the page specific script
  6. Admin page, sort by a date range




admin page:
   -move the id to the edit btn, eliminate the id column
   - add request publish date as column
   - increase form width to be 1100px
   - on hover over edit button, background turns green
   - increase items per page to 15
   - add request summary to the page
   - show only tickets that are new, in progress, and completed
   - add a toggle button to show  just windows or devices tickets
   - add toggle button to show new, in progress, Completed
   - move state column to the second column
   - add text if the request summary is null
   - show total in each state
   - change green button to blue (thank god)

  -restyle attachment input in edge and IE


  -rename currentUser to created by in power bi
